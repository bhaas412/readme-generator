# README Generator

## Description
This project is a README Generator that you can use in order to easily generate professional READMEs for any project you're working on.
The README Generator is a command-line interface tool written using Node.js that also uses the Inquirer NPM package to ask the user questions and gather responses in order to dynamically generate a README.md for a project.

Once the user answers all of the command-line prompts, a README.md is output to the current working directory. The README that is generated contains the following, with each section of the README being populated with the responses provided by the user:
- Project Title
- Project Description
- A Table of Contents that links to the following sections:
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - License (the selected license badge is also rendered at the top of the README)
  - Contributing
  - Tests
  - Questions

## Video Demo
